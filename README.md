# Task Tracker CLI

**Task Tracker CLI** is a command-line application built in Go for managing tasks efficiently. It allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks, as well as mark tasks as in progress or completed. Tasks are stored persistently in a JSON file, ensuring that your task list is available even after restarting the application.

---

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Update Tasks**: Update the description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks or filter tasks by status (e.g., `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`).
- **Mark Tasks**: Mark tasks as `in-progress` or `done`.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file, ensuring data persistence.

## Task Properties

Each task includes the following properties:

| Property   | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `id`       | Unique identifier for the task             |
| `description` | Short description of the task          |
| `status`   | Status of the task (`todo`, `in-progress`, `done`) |
| `createdAt`| Timestamp when the task was created        |
| `updatedAt`| Timestamp when the task was last updated   |

---

## Error Handling

Errors are gracefully handled to ensure the application doesn't crash unexpectedly. Common errors (e.g., invalid input, missing files) provide descriptive messages to the user.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for due dates and reminders.
- Implement sorting tasks by creation date or priority.
- Allow users to prioritize tasks.
- Introduce categories or labels for tasks.
